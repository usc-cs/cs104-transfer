# CS104-Transfer

For those seeking transfer credit for CSCI 104, we may ask you to demonstrate your mastery of important data structure topics such as balanced BSTs (AVL-Trees) and/or Hash Tables.

There are two subfolders (`bst-avl` and `hash`) that contain instructions in their respective `README.md` files.  Follow those instructions to complete the code provided in the skeleton files also present in each subfolder.  Test your code with the corresponding test/driver files.  We will run a separate suite of tests on your code once you submit.  To that end, for each assignment you completed (`bst-avl` and/or `hash`) please use **[this form](https://forms.gle/LS256p4wWsK6kmWb8)** to upload a .zip file of each individual folder (`bst-avl.zip` and/or `hash.zip`).

Good luck,
USC CS Dept.
